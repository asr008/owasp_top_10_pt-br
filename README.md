Foreword
Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure. As our softwa
re becomes increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The 
rapid pace of modern software development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this 
OWASP Top 10.

A great deal of feedback was received during the creation of the OWASP Top 10 2017, more than for any other equivalent 
OWASP effort. This shows how much passion the community has for the OWASP Top 10, and thus how critical it is for OWASP to get the Top 10 right for the majority of use cases.
Although the original goal of the OWASP Top 10 project was simply to raise awareness amongst developers and managers, it has become the
de facto application security standard.
In this release, issues and recommendations are written concisely and in a testable way to assist with the adoption of the 
OWASP Top 10 in application security programs. We encourage large and high performing organizations to use the 
OWASP 

Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
if a true standard is required, but for most, the OWASP Top 10 is a great 
start on the application security journey.

All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and 
chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving 
application security. 
We advocate approaching application security as a people, 
process, and technology problem, because the most 
effective approaches to application security require 
improvements in these areas.
OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from 
commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, 
practical, and cost
-
effective information about application 
security. 
OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, 
although we support the informed use of commercial security 
technology. OWASP produces many types of materials in a 
collaborative, transparent, and open way.
The OWASP Foundation is the non
-
profit entity that ensures 
the project's long
-
term success. Almost everyone associated 
with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP board, 
chapter leaders, project leaders, and project members.
We support innovative security research with grants and 
infrastructure.
